# CS-255
Work from the SNHU course CS-255: System Analysis and Design


The purpose of this project was to work with a client, DriverPass, in order to build a system that provides driving students with access to online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training. The system was designed to include an LMS for the online learning component as well as the ability to schedule appointments for driver training, either by the student online or through DriverPass's secretary in person or over the phone. The system would verify user login and allow for different kinds of users, giving the Owner full control over all accounts and the IT Officer the ability to update and maintain the system. The system would also be linked with the various local DMVs in order to automatically receive updates on new rules, course content, and practice questions.

In this project, I believe that my Business Requirements Document is strong. I described the purpose and background of the DriverPass system and covered the functional and non-functional requirements of the system fairly thoroughly. One part of this project that I could have done better was the UML Use Case Diagram. I did not account for the DMVs acting on the system in order to provide it with updates and I did not cover the include/extensions relationships between the use cases.

During this project I interpreted the user's needs by listening to them during the DriverPass interview and thoroughly incorporating all of the desired functionality that they laid out into  the system's design. It is extremely important to listen to the user's needs when designing a system because they are the ones who determine whether the system is a success or not. The success of a system is determined by how well it satisfies the user's needs.

While designing this system, I came to realize the importance of having a strong foundation for development through in-depth requirement collection. This helps to provide a clear path and end goal for a system's development. Having this deep understanding of what the system should do makes it much easier to begin to design how it will accomplish it.
